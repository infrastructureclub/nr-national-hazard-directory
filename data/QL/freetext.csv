All mains gas supply pipes up to and including the meter are the responsibility of National Grid. In case of emergency contact 0800 111 999. Natural gas is non-toxic, but large concentrations could cause suffocation. It is highly flammable and leakage from a pipeline could result in an explosive mixture with air.

The room giving access to the pump Room has an uneven floor with piles of sand and gravel and the lighting does not function. The Pump Room itself is well lit but includes many hazards. There are two deep shafts, one with a winch and apparatus and the other is an access to the lower pump area. This is fitted with a ladder and is undoubtedly a confined space. Another main hazard is the sump area which receives and redirects the water. These areas are fitted with barriers. There are two floor levels, floor slabs which are believed to cover cables, further electric cables and a switchboard. Waste materials and other materials, which may not be waste, litter the area. The hazards are electrical, slips, trips, falls, drowning and others associated with confined spaces.",10566731

"Pantograph Monitoring System cameras have been installed at Hyndland Station on the footbridge and will be working from 26th October 2019. The camera is located on the footbridge and contains lasers to be able to scan the pantograph. The cameras contains 2 types of lasers: ~LDS30 Laser Ranger ~- The laser rangers are used for distance measurements and for identifying when a train/pantograph is under the scanner. ~- The laser rangers are Laser Class 1 and herefore considered eye safe under all conditions. ~ZQ1 Line Laser ~- The line laser emits a laser line with an angel of 60 degrees.~- The line laser is not to be considered eye safe at the emitting point of the laser. However since the laser spreads its energy in an angle, the intensity per area decreases with the distance. ~It has been agreed that when work is taking place using machines underneath the cameras the cameras should be turned off. This can be done using the isolation switch on structure number B 03 42",10586069
