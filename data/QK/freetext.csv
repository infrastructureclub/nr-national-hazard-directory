Efficacy of ventilation to the area is uncertain. Some of the remote areas are unlit; much of the area is poorly and inadequately lit. These areas should be considered as confined spaces.Tripping hazards exist due to uneven floors and steps, especially in poorly lit areas. Exit directions are not posted around most of the area and there is a serious risk of personnel becoming lost or disorientated especially in unlit areas or if lights fail or are inadvertently turned off. There is evidence of vermin, and poisoned bait is present to control this hazard. Major foul drainage runs pass through the area, some suspended at head/shoulder height posing a collision hazard and a biological hazard in the event of leakage. Substantial water leakage from the roof.",110148460

Telecommunications equipment is also present. Contains a high level walkway accessed from the Ladies’ Toilet. This walkway is unguarded and littered with debris increasing the risk of tripping and falling to the floor, some considerable drop below. There is evidence of vermin, including poisoned bait, throughout the Rat Run.Due to the difficulty of access/egress and the poor ventilation to parts of the Rat Run, the area should be considered a confined space for certain activities e.g. hot work etc. ",110148462

Asbestos was found in the excavated material after it had left site so the exact location of origin of the Asbestos is unknown. The three small parts found were the internal cement based small diameter drainage pipe - Chrysotile & gave no airbourne risks.",110166729

"The touch potential between the traction return running rails and the steel bridge decking is potentially higher than normal or desirable levels, however, it does meet requirements of BS EN 50122 for long term touch potentials. Where reasonably practicable planned works should be performed under isolation, however, at this location there is possibly of traction return current from adjacent lines still being present on those lines under isolation. In terms of fault and incident response this could be under isolation such as an emergency switch off for example, however, other control measures must be implemented like mandated use of 1000v gloves, mandated use of insulated tools and equipment, mandated use of non-conductive material such as rubber matting where there is a risk of metallic items and components being used or coming into contact between the metallic bridge decking and running / check rails that are at a different potential to each other",110173195

"The touch potential between the traction return running rails and the steel bridge decking is potentially higher than normal or desirable levels, however, it does meet requirements of BS EN 50122 for long term touch potentials. Where reasonably practicable planned works should be performed under isolation, however, at this location there is possibly of traction return current from adjacent lines still being present on those lines under isolation. In terms of fault and incident response this could be under isolation such as an emergency switch off for example, however, other control measures must be implemented like mandated use of 1000v gloves, mandated use of insulated tools and equipment, mandated use of non-conductive material such as rubber matting where there is a risk of metallic items and components being used or coming into contact between the metallic bridge decking and running / check rails that are at a different potential to each other",110173193

The Concourse hatch has a ‘fixed’ ladder whilst the Access Bridge hatches require portable ladders to reach them. By necessity the hatches are located in so that with the ladders in position to gain access they present a hazard to members of the public and other persons; Contractors should take this into account when gaining access.The close proximity of the Access Bridge lift motor door in relation to the roof hatch leads to an increased risk of falling.

"The platforms have voids beneath. Access to these voids is via manholes/inspection covers. It should be noted that drain, manhole and other inspection covers might are likely to be sealed for security purposes. Contractors should seek guidance from the Network Rail Shift Station Manager when such covers are found to be sealed. Lighting standards are sited on those areas of the platforms not covered by the concourse or other canopy. Drain pipes, lighting standards and other fixed hazards on the platform are identified with diagonal black and yellow stripes. Contractors should ensure that this identification is replaced where work results in its damage or removal. Each platform has lifts giving access to the Concourse and the Access Bridge. In addition, platforms 1/2 and 3/4 have escalators leading to the Concourse and Access Bridge.",110148424
