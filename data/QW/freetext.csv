"There are also two plant rooms. One contains a boiler the other an air-cooling unit. Each of the plant rooms has an internal bund wall approximately 4 high which presents a tripping hazard at the entrance doors.The boiler is gas fed and both rooms contain electrical control equipment and plant.There are numerous pipes, ducting and electrical cables suspended from the ceiling of the raft. Work in this area is hampered by the space available and its access. May need to be considered as a confined space.The raft is constructed above and spans platforms 1 to 10. Access is via spiral staircases contained within glass-enclosed wells. Work on the external fabric of the structure would require scaffold etc. Access to the roof of the raft is via vertical fixed ladders <one at each end> from the accommodation level. There is no evidence of panels containing asbestos.The main hazards associated with this area are electrical, gas, water, limited space, falls from height, tripping.",110147894

The primary purpose of the Haliford end hop-up is to facilitate a driver changing ends of a 10 car set in order to perform a Z-shunt move back into the Up Siding. The Up Siding buffer stop end hop-up is to allow drivers access on and off the cab from the walking route.
