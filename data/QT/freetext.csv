"The pipe is 220mm diameter Cast Iron and sits approximately 0.75m below ground level. It is suspected to be redundant however this has not been confirmed by any testing. The function and source of the pipe is not known. Various attempts were made to trace the pipe however they were not successful. It is suspected to be foul drainage related to a nearby malting house or previous redundant sidings however these assumptions were not confirmed. A drawing markup is attached showing its approximate location. The pipe was uncovered beneath the maintenance access track approx 3.4m from the redundant platform wall, it extends towards the London end and bends beneath the platform approx 40m to the wast. The pipe was traced and is suspected to run east through the car park past the station building, it is then suspected to connect to the south to the vegetated area.           ~
