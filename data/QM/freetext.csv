"Maintenance access point for all types including Road Rail vehicles for the Canal Tunnels, the access route is off York Way through a wayleave that crosses Argent Land. There will always be 3.5m clearance for this access. To allow access with vehicles there needs to be an isolation of the new Canel Tunnels lines but also an isolation of the Up&Down slows on the ECML. The RRAP has a fairly tight curve and steep gradient so extra care must be taken when accessing machines down there. Metal drainage cover also located on the slope is a potential hazard due to lack of surface traction especially in wet weather conditions. Within the Argent Land a parking provision for 1 no. van is available but no machines must be left within the wayleave access across Argent land.

"Flowing through a catchment of Oolite Limestone, the River Ise is the best example in the county of a lowland river on clay, fed by base-rich water.

Between Barford Bridge railway viaduct and the village of Geddington, the river channel is narrow and meandering with numerous sharp bends and loops; the alternating series of pools, slacks, riffles and runs modify the water flow. The substrate is equally varied with silty pools, gravel shoals and beds and bare clay. Areas of tall fen, woodland and semi-improved grassland along the main banks, together with an area of species-rich flood meadow, provide additional habitats which complement the interest of the site.
